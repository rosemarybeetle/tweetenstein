tweet-based physical interactive thing
A.Lewis. Started January 2014

The eventual out come of this will be to provide the brains for a physical interactive.
The intention is to create a self-contained unit using a Raspberry Pi running Python to access web data from Google, Twitter as required and manipulate and store it.
A python web server will run a simple html5 page with javascript loading data saved by the concurrent Python harvester.

Actual final concept and shape of the interactive tbc.
